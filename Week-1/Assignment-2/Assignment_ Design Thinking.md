*Visual Representation of Road Intersection*


This is an intersection where two perpendicular roads are meeting. Both roads have one lane of traffic traveling in opposite directions. The intersection is meeting safety standards for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

There is safe pedestrian and bike passage to go to and from work, to go to and from a public transportation stop nearby (marked as **C** in the image). 

There is a path along this safe pedestrian and bike passage which is intended to be used by pedestrians as well as people with disabilities (marked as **A** in the image). These paths have slopes at the end for people on wheelchairs.

Just after the bike passage, there’s a buffer that can be seen in green color in the image. These buffers work as a separation between the pathways and add up to more safety.

The roads with 3 lanes where vehicles can be seen coming towards the intersection are broad enough to minimize most of the traffic. These roads are marked as **D** in the image above. The 3 lanes are for vehicles going in 3 different directions (left, straight and right respectively).

There’s another buffer after these roads which is acting as separation between 3 lane and 2 lane roads.

The vehicles exiting the intersection need less number of lanes as they don’t have to wait for traffic signals anymore. Hence, the 2 lane roads.

These roads are marked as **F** in the image.

For pedestrians who want to cross the road from one corner of the intersection to the other, a crosswalk has been designed marked as **E** in the image.

And finally, every intersection needs traffic lights which control movement of the traffic in a timely and uniform way. These traffic lights are marked as **B** in the image.

**Areas of improvement**

- Out of 3 lanes in the roads, one lane can be used for School buses only, from 7AM to 9AM which will lessen the traffic in other lanes caused by big vehicles at prime times.

**Future Iterations**

- Flyovers can be built as they do not intercept the road but provide a passage over the road without blocking the path below.
- Buffers can be removed to make more space for the incoming vehicles, which can further reduce the congestion.
- Roundabout can be built to avoid congestion in the middle of the intersection.
