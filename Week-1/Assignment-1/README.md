# Smarto launches Virtual Whiteboard for Schools and Institutions

## _Smarto&#39;s Virtual Whiteboard enables Teachers to get shared whiteboards for conducting online classes._

#### _April 2nd, 2022_. At Smarto, we&#39;re set out to redefine Online Classes. Smarto whiteboard is an ideal and smart technology for schools struggling to engage students in the classroom lessons. Paper-based lessons and static whiteboards/chalkboards don&#39;t connect well with students in this digital era. But with our whiteboard, students will tune in even before the class starts because the classes won&#39;t just be a text-based lesson but much more. The whiteboard enables improved learning through increased collaboration and participation among students. It will enable interactive and effective group activities like problem-solving and brainstorming.

#### An interactive whiteboard in the classroom provides teachers with innovative and new ways to teach the same subject content to the students. If something is technologically equipped, students automatically gain interest which helps in better understanding and remembering of concepts. It enhances collaborations where teachers can work on the whiteboard in real time.

#### Smarto&#39;s Virtual Whiteboard solves the problem of non-interactive and recorded sessions by giving the teachers and students larger space to write and work out the ideas together in a live approach. It boosts the efficiency of online engagement. Learning from home has become the new normal, and schools need a product that comes with all the bells and whistles necessary for interactive sessions. And Smarto&#39;s virtual Whiteboard is the solution.

#### &quot;_We are excited to help our customers with the intelligent and interactive whiteboard to improve the classroom teaching-learning experience.&#39;&#39;_ said Vishen Louis, VP of Product at Smarto, _&quot;with Smarto Virtual Whiteboard, we are giving our share towards building future leaders .&quot;_

#### &quot;_Educational Institutions need a change in their teaching style because students don&#39;t like traditional classroom learning. Thanks to Smarto Virtual Whiteboard! It is improving the performance and boosting the engagement of our students&#39;&#39;_ said Prem Agrawal, Chairman of Delhi Public School, _&quot;Smarto&#39;s Virtual Whiteboard became our favorite product. I am so thankful to Smarto for building an online interactive and collaborative setup!&quot;_
